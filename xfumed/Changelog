*	If backup file exist, don't overwrite it, i.e. only make an initial
	backup of the user's menu file
*	Fixed bug that prevented addition of submenus
*	Changed all relevant functions to use list_allmenus global variable 
	directly, instead of through a pointer argument. This caused 
	unpredictable crashes (I don't know why)
