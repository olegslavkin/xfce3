XFce user menu editor
---------------------
Idea based on an earlier version by Alex Lambert <alex@penwing.uklinux.net>.
The user interface was initially created using glade (ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME).

The application shows one menulevel (starting with the root user menu). 
Controls are available to go to a submenu and back to the parent menu and 
the items can be moved up and down.

In the 'Edit item' section new items, submenus and separators can be added 
and existing entries can be updated or removed.

The save button saves the menu to the user's .xfce/xfwm.user_menu file (an 
existing version is backed up to *.old). Reset re-reads the file.

Quit ends the application, with an iritating dialog to remind you to save 
your changes.

NB
xfumed will NOT save comments in a user menu file!


Programmer's information
------------------------
The complete user menu is stored in a combination of linked lists and 
specialized data structures:

GList *menulist  :  doubly linked list with all (sub)menus
|
+->*data => RootMenu *menu  :  structure containing menu data
         |
         |-> gchar *name  :  internal menu name
         |-> gchar *parent  :  optional name of parent menu
         +-> GList *entries  :  items and submenus
             |
             +->*data => ItemData *item  : structure containing item data
                      |
                      |-> ItemType type  : ITEM, SUBMENU or NOP
                      |-> gchar *name  :  internal name (for submenus)
                      |-> gchar *caption  :  caption shown in menu
                      +-> gchar *command  : command to execute (for items)

The current menu is shown using a GtkCList (columned list). Changing to a 
sub- or parent menu reads a menu from the above data system.
