Known bugs:

Only when extracting from tarfile from one xftree window to a *different* xftree window:
 - If action is move (and tarfile is not compressed), extracted file is deleted but the    ctree is not updated.
 - If action is extract, the created file has mode 0640 instead of the mode of the
   file within the tarfile.
