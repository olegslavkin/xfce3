- Add code necesary to d+d files to/from xfsamba. 
  (most of this happens in xfsamba).
- gtk-2

Maybe (only if repeatedly requested):
- The pasteboard should communicate to other application via the normal
  X pasteboard.
- add "save user shortcutkeys" to config options:
    (does gtk store the custom values in the associated accel?
    if so, how do you retrieve the values?)
- open a "goto desktop", to open the ROX desktop. 
    (this implies enabling d+d to the root window)

BUGS to fix:
- dialogs should open in the same screen as the xftree window
  when dealing with xinerama.
