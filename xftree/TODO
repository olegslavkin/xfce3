1- Some configuration options  
2- An "all" button when doing hard deletes
3- Debug the "goto" option (seems the "fork" may lose variables at times).
4- gtk-2 
5.- Somehow be able to show the total size of a folder including all it's
content, sub-folders and their content.
6.- MC style opening of packed files: Click on files and you see the internal
structure as if it wasn't packed. Makes it very easy to copy and move content
from these files straight to where you want it.
7- Add code necesary to d+d files to/from xfsamba.


And yes. XFtree is a marvel. Fast, always there, and always in use.
