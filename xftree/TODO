- Toolbar icon + menu elements for "print"
- Use the conventional Xpasteboard and provide compatibility with
  other file managers and programs for cut+paste (also for the
  future rsync option). Perhaps still use the private file for
  distinguising copies from moves from rsyncs
- Create a linked list of "cut paths", "copied paths" so as to change
  the icons if the paths happen to be in the way of an update_tree. also,
  the changing of the X pasteboard should cause a update_tree (because of
  the icon story).i.e., changing the Xpastboard caused an update of the
  linked lists cut/copy, which in turn, when changed, causes an update_tree
  event.
- add rsync by d+d between two xftrees running on two different
  hosts, but on the same X display
- Enable "open with" from the innards of tar files. This implies extracting
  to /tmp first, then calling cb_open_with. It requires cleanup of temporary
  files on exit of xftree (all), and thus requires capture of sigint,
  sigsegv, sigkill, sigusr and any other that causes program termination.
  create global push_tmp_file(char *path), clean_tmp_files(gboolean verbose),
  and on extracting to a temp file, don't lose the extension so registered 
  programs will keep working.
- Enable .deb expansion. (I need a debian box to do the testing first).
- Figure out Prasad's bug in solaris.
- Add code necesary to d+d files to/from xfsamba. 
  (most of this happens in xfsamba).
- add an application to open a gdk_pixmap canvas to paint thumbtack
  previews of all .jpg, .png, .gif, .xpm in selected directory.
  This should be separate code from xftree, like xfglob.
- gtk-2

Maybe (only if repeatedly requested):
- add "save user shortcutkeys" to config options:
    (does gtk store the custom values in the associated accel?
    if so, how do you retrieve the values?)
- open a "goto desktop", to open the ROX desktop. 
    (this implies enabling d+d to the root window)

BUGS to fix:
- dialogs should open in the same screen as the xftree window
  when dealing with xinerama, or atleast center located.
