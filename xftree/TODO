--> xfsamba dnd:
- enable more than one file dropped
- enable directory drop
- enable copy + paste, must use X clipboard by now.

- MUST FIX A WORKAROUND: 
  Damn gtk bug of mistaking a drag from another widget with a drag initiation
  on the same widget (only on first drag)


- incorporate hostnames for dnd so rcp works with rox. Add the rsync option
  with choice for rsh, ssh ssh2.
- incorporate root level entries for roxy pinboards
- incorporate xfglob results as main level tree entries
- recursive chown, chmod, chgrp in setting properties.
- In xtree_tar.c, when determining "mode", do a search of all open xfree
  windows until the extracted file is found (tar_extract()) (what ?)
- Toolbar icon + menu elements for "print"
- Use the conventional Xpasteboard and provide compatibility with
  other file managers and programs for cut+paste (also for the
  future rsync option). Perhaps still use the private file for
  distinguising copies from moves from rsyncs
- Create a linked list of "cut paths", "copied paths" so as to change
  the icons if the paths happen to be in the way of an update_tree. also,
  the changing of the X pasteboard should cause a update_tree (because of
  the icon story).i.e., changing the Xpastboard caused an update of the
  linked lists cut/copy, which in turn, when changed, causes an update_tree
  event. (what ?) 
- (see above) add rsync by d+d between two xftrees running on two different
  hosts, but on the same X display or something equivalent like adding rsync 
  nodes at the root level.
- Enable .deb expansion. (I need a debian box to do the testing first).
- Add code necesary to d+d files from xfsamba. 
- gtk-2

Maybe (only if repeatedly requested):
- add "save user shortcutkeys" to config options:
    (does gtk store the custom values in the associated accel?
    if so, how do you retrieve the values?)
- open a "goto desktop", to open the ROX desktop. 
    (this implies enabling d+d to the root window)
