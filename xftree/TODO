1- Some configuration options  
3- Debug the "goto" option (seems the "fork" may lose variables at times).
4- gtk-2 
6.- MC style opening of packed files: Click on files and you see the internal
structure as if it wasn't packed. Makes it very easy to copy and move content
from these files straight to where you want it.
7- Add code necesary to d+d files to/from xfsamba.
8- Add ctrl-T for keyboard shortcut to open terminal. Probably keyboard shorcuts for all menu items, toggled from config file.
9- Override file dialog should lstat both new and old file and show info so user can decide whether or not to override. Also, on non-confirm copy operation, if file will be overwritten, ask for confirmation, please.
10- Instead of opening multiple boxes for multiple copying, open a single box and use a progress status bar. (easier for the user to do something else while long copy operation takes place.

done:
 2- An "all" button when doing hard deletes.
 5.- Somehow be able to show the total size of a folder including all it's
content, sub-folders and their content.
->  ctrl-u or select from right button menu over folders gives diskusage

And yes. XFtree is a marvel. Fast, always there, and always in use.
